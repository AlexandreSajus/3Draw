# 3Draw

This is a Processing project in which calculates the position of a colorful object by using the data of 2 webcams (which names can be define in the config.txt file), and displays it.
The user can draw lines, change the color, the weight and the drawing mode.
The program can communicate with other porgrams (like Unity for instance) if they send a "get" request through the right port.

Here are some images from a french presentation of the project made in 2017.

## The drawing pen

A pen has been created (not by me) using 3D printing to work with the program.
