# 3Draw

This is a Processing project in which calculates the position of a colorful object by using the data of 2 webcams (which names can be define in the config.txt file), and displays it.
The user can draw lines, change the color, the weight and the drawing mode.
The program can communicate with other porgrams (like Unity for instance) if they send a "get" request through the right port.
